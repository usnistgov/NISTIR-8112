# Attribute Metadata: Public Draft Open For Comments!

</section>


Welcome to the NIST IR 8112 Public Draft!  We're excited to share  this publication and collaboratively enhance it openly with our stakeholder community.

Click [here](NISTIR-8112.html) to access the document.

## Note to Reviewers

Feedback on any part of this publication is welcome and encouraged. We opted to publish this document as a NISTIR in an effort to treat it as an _implementers’ draft_, an approach common in the development lifecycle of many private sector standards and specifications. This allows the developer and policy community, in both the public and private sectors, to apply some or all of the metadata in this NISTIR on a volunteer basis, and provide us with practical feedback gained through implementation experience. 
 
There will be a formal 60-day (XX-XX) comment period to gain initial feedback on the document in order to finalize. However, we are also interested in the application of the NISTIR’s schema in actual solutions and implementations. As such, we will be maintaining this public page beyond the initial 60-day period to continually receive input and iteratively improve the document in anticipation of a second revision. Some specific questions we are interested in answering both in the short and long term include:
 
- Does this bring value to federated scenarios and identity solutions?
- Would your community or organization profile this schema to support a specific solution or sector?
- Is the body of attribute and attribute value metadata complete?  What is missing? What should be removed?
- Is the categorization adequate and complete?  Did we miss anything that is critical to improve trust and confidence in decision making based on federated attributes?
- Is trust-time vs. run-time sufficiently considered?  Should the defined attribute metadata be shifted among these two lifecycle phases?
- Is the delineation between attribute and attribute value metadata clear and are both required in this schema?
- Is level of effort required to integrate and leverage the schema commensurate with the value of the schema?
- Does the addition of the metadata negatively impact performance of systems?
 
Commenters are **STRONGLY** encouraged to publically collaborate with the team and other participants via GitHub—see [this page](comment_help.html) for details on how to submit a comment. In order to maintain a lean approach we would prefer to receive comments through GitHub rather than via email, Excel, or other file types. However, we will accept comments in these formats—they can be sent to <nsticwks@nist.gov>. In instances where comments come to us outside of GitHub, we will post them, preserving commenter anonymity, so that we can continue to manage and track edits using “issues” native to GitHub. We thank you in advance for your efforts to keep this process streamlined for the editors.
